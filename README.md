# Mutual-Funds
This README details the comprehensive approach to managing a student-run mutual fund, focusing on fundamental and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuations to optimize portfolio performance. By meticulously selecting 16 companies across 9 diverse sectors, we enhanced the fund's stability and growth potential. Our rigorous analysis of over 50 mid-cap companies resulted in a notable 13.3% return and an alpha of +19.85, demonstrating superior performance relative to the benchmark. The development of comprehensive equity research reports, including elaborative analyses on Exide and Polymedicure, involved thorough investment analysis and meticulous risk assessments, ensuring informed decision-making and strategic portfolio adjustments. These efforts collectively contributed to the fund's robust performance and exemplified a methodical approach to mutual fund management.
